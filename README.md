# Urho3D Open Space Program
An experiment by Capital-Asterisk, to see if (another) Open Space Program can be made with Urho3D. This repository is at the point where 10N thrust rockets can be built out of different sized cubes, and brought to life with the physics engine. The code has some hidden things on the insides, such as a way of organizing usable parts and performance curves.

For 6 months, this repository has actually been for a broken planet rendering algorithm.
